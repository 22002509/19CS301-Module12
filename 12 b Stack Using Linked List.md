# Ex.No 12.b Stack Using Linked List â€“ Push and Index Display

## Aim
To write a Python program to insert 3 elements into a stack and print the index values of each element.

## Algorithm

1.  Start
2.  Create an empty stack using a list
3.  Append 3 elements to the stack using a loop
4.  Use a loop to iterate through the stack
        - For each element, print its index and value
5.  Print the stack elements along with their corresponding index values
6.  Stop
## Program

```python
#Reg.NO:212222040120
#Name:PRASANNA R
stack = []

stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')

print('Initial stack: ' + str(stack))
for i in stack:
    print(stack.index(i),i)


```
