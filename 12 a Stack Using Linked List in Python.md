# Ex.No 12.a Stack Using Linked List in Python

This project demonstrates a basic stack implementation in Python using list methods to mimic linked list behavior. It includes stack operations like **push**, **display**, **peek**, and **pop**.

## AIM

To write a Python program to push elements into a stack and display them.
## ALGORITHM

1.Initialize an empty list to represent the stack.
2.Accept the number of elements to push.
3.Use append() to push each element onto the stack.
4.After pushing all elements, display the stack.


## PROGRAM

```python
#Reg.NO:212222040120
#Name:PRASANNA R
stack = []

stack.append('a')
stack.append('b')
stack.append('c')
print("Stack after elements are pushed:")
print(stack)
```
